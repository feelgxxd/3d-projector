This repo contains a simple 3D renderer that projects a cube and rotates it in the 3D space.

I chose rendering a cube because it is easier to explain.

You can change the color of the cube, background, frame rate etc. Feel free to tweak around with it.
You can also render different shapes with a little bit of tweak on the code.
